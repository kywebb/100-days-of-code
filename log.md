# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 31, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Fixed portfolio website. Updated it with more client websites for potential employers to see. 

**Thoughts:** I'm very comfortable coding simply with JavaScript since most of my clients don't need substantially big websites where I must rely on a framework, but I want to push myself and make more websites with different frameworks to see which one's I like the best. 

I am used a tutorial that is helping me stay up-to-date with the new JS in case I have the opportunity incorporate any of the handy features into my coding projects.

My goal is to do every single easy Leetcode problem, so here we go!

### Day 1: February 1, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Started building a counter application and I'll continue it tomorrow. 
I also did some JavaScript problems. 

**Thoughts:** Something is really wrong with my react dependencies. The testing
and the react itself are off and it keeps creating an extra JSON file, so I have to keep deleting it.
