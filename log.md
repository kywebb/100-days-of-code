# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 31st, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Fixed portfolio website. Updated it with more client websites for potential employers to see. 

**Thoughts:** I'm very comfortable coding simply with JavaScript, but I want to push myself and make more websites with different frameworks so that I can showcase that I have multiple projects with different frameworks under my belt.
